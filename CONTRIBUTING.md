## Contributing

Contributions to fabricate are welcome! However, we do have a couple dependencies that you need to get up and running. 

1. Install and run a [MeiliSearch](https://docs.meilisearch.com/guides/introduction/quick_start_guide.html) instance
2. Install [A local MongoDB server](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community)
3. Run `mongod --dbpath path/to/db`
4. Everything should be setup and you should be ready to contribute.

A docker container for all of this is coming soon to make this process easier.
